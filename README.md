# Potion Craft Analog (Pygame)

## Project overview

This project is a rough sketch of a game using the PyGame engine. It is supposed to be an analog of a popular game "Potion Craft". Also in this project I'm using database through the Python library "sqlite".

Currently in the game you have to windows. In the first one you can make potions by throwing ingrediens in the pot and then sturring it up. The potion that you made you can sell in the second window to the customers, but each customer only wants a specific type of potion.

## Getting started

Firstly, you need to install Python library "PyGame". That's all for the preparations!

To run the game, simply execute the main.py file.
